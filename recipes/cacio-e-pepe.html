    <p>This Bucatini cacio e pepe recipe has been made in our family for many years, and everyone loves it. It is a very basic and easy variation on mac and cheese.</p>
    <ul><b>Ingredients:</b>
        <li>1 pound Bucatini</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 Â¾ cups grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <ol><b>Directions:</b>
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook bucatini in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Reserve 1 cup cooking water, then drain Bucatini.</li>
    <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir garlic and pepper in hot oil until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add cooked spaghetti and Pecorino Romano cheese. Ladle in 1/2 cup reserved cooking water; stir until cheese is melted, about 1 minute. Stir in more cooking water as needed, 1 tablespoon at a time, until sauce coats bucatini, about 1 minute more.</li>
    </ol>
